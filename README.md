# Welcome to Kenneth's Rust CheatRepo!

This repository contains a collection of Rust code blocks for learning, along with a few comprehensive Rust cheat sheets. It is designed to help you learn Rust through hands-on practice and easy-to-reference resources.

If, like me, you love challenges and are a seeker of self-tought knowledge, here’s what I suggest:

- **Read the cheat sheets** for an easy and quick way to grasp knowledge. Then, reinforce your memory by rebuilding the cheat sheets as if you were teaching Rust to your little cousin.
- **Do the exercises** to better understand the topics.
- **Read the entire official documentation** to finally solidify your understanding by reading the official documentation and having the chance to correct possible mistakes.

My methodical approach to learning has proven to be practically successful. I hope it will be for you too!

## Learning Philosophy

I believe that humans can explain things better than an AI can. Why? Because unlike AI, an intelligent human knows what it means not to know something and understands what is needed for a better learning process. This is why knowing how to make a query to an AI is essential and why it is not an immediate task. This is where my cheat sheets come into play. Use AI for further insights.
