# Rust Exercise CheatRepo

Welcome to Rust Exercise CheatRepo! This repository contains a collection of Rust code blocks for learning, along with a comprehensive Rust cheat sheet. It is designed to help you learn Rust through hands-on practice and easy-to-reference resources.

If, like me, you love challenges and are a seeker of self-tought knowledge, hereâ€™s what I suggest:

- **Read the cheat sheets** for an easy and quick way to grasp knowledge. Then, reinforce your memory by rebuilding the cheat sheets as if you were teaching Rust to your little cousin.
- **Do the exercises** to better understand the topics.
- **Read the entire official documentation** to finally solidify your understanding by reading the official documentation and having the chance to correct possible mistakes.

My methodical approach to learning has proven to be practically successful. I hope it will be for you too!
